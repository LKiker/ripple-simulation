# Ripple Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates **wave propagation** across a 2D surface using a **heightmap-based physics model**.  
When the user clicks or taps the canvas, a circular disturbance (“ripple”) forms and spreads outward, interacting with other waves in real time.  
The simulation visualizes the **2D wave equation** using color mapping to show height variations.

## Features
- Real-time **2D wave simulation** (discrete wave equation)  
- **Interactive clicks/taps** to generate ripples  
- Adjustable **wave speed** and **damping** controls  
- **Color-mapped visualization** (blue = low, white = high)  
- Ripple **collision and interference patterns**  
- Runs entirely in the **browser using WebGL and JavaScript**

---

## How It Works
The simulation models the surface as a **heightmap grid**, where each cell stores a height value.

## Controls

| Action | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Click / Tap** | Create a new ripple at cursor position |
| **Wave Speed** | Adjust how fast ripples travel |
| **Damping** | Adjust how quickly ripples lose energy |
